Problems with existing system:

Some of the features exist as mobile apps requiring users to download it to their phones if they want to use the features  
Certain features not available to other OS users
Some features not commonly known to all students 
Have to go through many different web pages to access frequently needed information
For eg: Would have to open multiple tabs to look at various information but combining all the commonly used features into one web app would make it easier
No standard for SFU group work
		For eg: Do we use Fb, or twitter for group communication
